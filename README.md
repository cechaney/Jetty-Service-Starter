# Micro Service Starter
A Jetty embedded web application built as as jar with Maven.

This project is an excellent starter for a micro-service and a good alternative
to options like Spring Boot.

It includes the following...
1. Static asset serving via the DefaultServlet
2. A ProxyServlet to front any web resource needed to overcome CORS
